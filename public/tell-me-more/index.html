I for one, still believing in the <em>personal website</em>, have taken the middle way, and added this (somewhat) hidden, but more personal, second page.</p><p><img src=more1.jpg alt="image alt"></p><h3 id=heading></h3><h2 id=so-why-coding>So, why coding?</h2><p>Although I take with the grain of salt the idea that technology was the best thing that happened to the human race since the Bing Bang, there&rsquo;s no denying that this is the first time in history when we finally got to practicing magic. Not the old-school, Harry Potter, make-believe kind of magic, but actual, real life, consequential magic: we might not have flying cars, but we have self-driving one; we might not have teleportation, but we can communicate in real time regardless of the distance.</p><p>For me, the craziest thing is the <em>alchemy</em> behind it all: being able to do virtually anything, and change anything into anything else by simply manipulating some written symbols. Crazy, isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>But before we get too philosophical, let&rsquo;s not forget about the simple craftsman&rsquo;s pleasure of making thing. Things that others will use, or things made simply for the pleasure of making them.</p><h2 id=my-setup>My Setup</h2><p>I daily run Fedora with gnome, alongside a Ubuntu bare metal home server and a Digital Ocean VPS. I generally write my stuff in VSCode, with the Vim extension, and when I work in JavaScript my dev environment consists of TypeScript, Prettier, a11y, and the Airbnb ESLint extension.</p><h3 id=languages>Languages</h3><p>JavaScript is my main language, but I also work in Python, do Bash scripts and use a bit of YAML. And of course, Go.</p><h3 id=databases>Databases</h3><p>My databases of choice are MongoDB and postgreSQL.</p><h3 id=the-backend>The backend</h3><p>I use ngnix as proxy with a Digital Ocean server. I sometimes use Docker containers.</p><p>Below is a pic of my glorious current workflow, with the langchain container, local server, vps and tmux in action, and a sprinkle of Go for good measure.</p><p><img src=more2.png alt="image alt"></p></section><div class="w-full flex justify-center py-7"><a href=/ class="font-semibold px-4 py-4 border-2 border-black dark:border-white rounded-sm hover:bg-orange-500 focus:outline-none w-full md:w-1/2 flex items-center justify-center">Go back</a></div></section></div><footer id=footer><section class="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-4 flex justify-between items-center"><div class="w-1/3 flex justify-center text-white"></div><div class="text-[0.75rem] flex justify-center text-white dark:text-black">Made with love and Hugo</div><div class="w-1/3 flex justify-end gap-4"></div></section></footer><script src=/js/main.js></script></body></html>
