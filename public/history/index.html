As it was made in JavaScript, I naturally called it Go. And that&rsquo;s how I developed a taste for coding.</p><p>After a health break, I took the great leap of faith, and dedicated my entire energy to programming. So far, I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with everything the computer gods have thrown at me, from React to Python and Go, from Bash to Docker, and from NextJS to AWS.</p><p>My approach is varied and flexible; I don&rsquo;t shy away from experimenting with the new and learning the why behind the written code.</p><p>Always curious, my aim to explore, excel and deliver.</p><p>My guiding principle is complexity hidden in simplicity.</p></section><div class="w-full flex justify-center py-7"><a href=/ class="font-semibold px-4 py-4 border-2 border-black dark:border-white rounded-sm hover:bg-orange-500 focus:outline-none w-full md:w-1/2 flex items-center justify-center">Go back</a></div></section></div><footer id=footer><section class="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-4 flex justify-between items-center"><div class="w-1/3 flex justify-center text-white"></div><div class="text-[0.75rem] flex justify-center text-white dark:text-black">Made with love and Hugo</div><div class="w-1/3 flex justify-end gap-4"></div></section></footer><script src=/js/main.js></script></body></html>
