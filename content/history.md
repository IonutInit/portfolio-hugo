A former linguistics student, I ran a successful e-commerce business until 2021.

It was there that I made my first serious coding project, a complete e-commerce solution attending virtually every need of the business. As it was made in JavaScript, I naturally called it Go. And that's how I developed a taste for coding.

After a health break, I took the great leap of faith, and dedicated my entire energy to programming. So far, I've been experimenting with everything the computer gods have thrown at me, from React to Python and Go, from Bash to Docker, and from NextJS to AWS.

My approach is varied and flexible; I don't shy away from experimenting with the new and learning the why behind the written code.

Always curious, my aim to explore, excel and deliver.

My guiding principle is complexity hidden in simplicity.
