    demoLink: https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/konvertor/id6450120315
    github: https://github.com/IonutInit/konvertor
    text: The only unit converter app that not only accepts multiple inputs and provides multiple outputs, but has two different calculators integrated to help navigate the intricacies of unit conversions. For example you can find how many hours and minutes are in 3 weeks and 5 days (or 3 weeks minus 5 days); or how many miles per hour are 5 inches per minutes. One additional feature is an experimental voice command.

    text: A full logic implementation of one of the best "choose-your-own-path" adventure books. Alice makes a new trip to Wonderland, where she has to fight terrible enemies (sometimes more at once) and meet new, quirky characters. Hard decisions await at every step, while various artifacts and of course, her own growing abilities, help her along the way.

    text: A complete, custom, e-commerce solution attending to every need a small e-commerce business can have. It consisted of two main components, accountancy and product management. The former calculated sales, UK and EU tax, costs, providing consolidated data to be fed into an accountancy software. The latter handled everything from inventory management, price automation, listing and help with shipping.
